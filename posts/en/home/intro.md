Born in 1991 in France and based between Paris and Lille, I am a **senior fullstack developer** and **independent CTO**, active in the field since 2013. With a diverse experience in **developing web platforms and websites** for companies in various sectors such as finance and real estate, I recently expanded my expertise as a CTO at Blacksmith, an innovative web agency based in Paris. There, I worked closely with leaders in the video game world and esports tournaments. As a CTO, I was involved in the development of key projects, strategic technological decision-making, and the technical direction of the company.

My passion for creating and **supporting MVPs** (Minimum Viable Products) from their inception is at the heart of my profession. I consider each product as living, and place particular importance on the follow-up and evolutionary maintenance of projects. With an initial training in **design** and an unwavering passion for **computer development**, I combine these skills to bring a unique added value to each project and an **optimization** of creation/development times.
